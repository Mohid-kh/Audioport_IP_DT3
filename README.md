This IP core implements a modular audio port with the following main blocks:

## Modules

- **Control Unit**: Manages configuration and control of the audio system.
- **DSP**: Performs basic digital signal processing on the audio stream.
- **CDC**: Handles clock domain crossing between system and audio clocks.
- **I2S**: Implements the I2S protocol for audio input/output.
